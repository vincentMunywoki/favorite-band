                <h2>The short history</h2>
                The band was formed in 2005 as an a cappella group by Baraza, Chimano and Savara, who 
                had met at the Upper Hill High School and performed in Voices in the Light, a music 
                group at the school.[2][3] They then met guitarist Otieno, who attended Strathmore School, 
                at the Alliance française in Nairobi, where they would frequent and decided to form Sauti 
                (Swahili for "sound") and immediately wrote their first song, "Mafunzo ya Dunia" (Literally:
                lessons of the world), which would later feature in their debut studio album Mwanzo.
                [5] The band later added the Spanish word "Sol" (sun) to their name and formed Sauti Sol
                (supposed to mean "voices in the sun").[11] In 2006, the band participated in the Spotlight
                on Kenyan Music competition, hosted by the Alliance française in Nairobi. 
                They were included in the album compilation recording and later got signed to Penya Records.
                [12] The four members all completed their university education in Kenya.
                Baraza studied journalism at the United States International University,
                while Savara studied commerce and finance at Africa Nazarene University.
                Chimano studied journalism at the University of Nairobi, while Otieno studied actuarial science 
                at the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology.[11]

                <h2>African Sauce and Midnight Train</h2>
                Sauti Sol's fourth studio album Afrikan Sauce was released on 31 January 2019. Primarily an
                Afropop and R&B record, Afrikan Sauce marked a departure from the traditional acoustic sound 
                of their previous albums. It features guest appearances from Patoranking, Tiwa Savage, Burna Boy, 
                Vanessa Mdee, Yemi Alade, Khaligraph Jones, Nyashinski, Bebe Cool, Mi Casa, Toofan, Jah Prayzah 
                and C4 Pedro.[28] The album comprises 13 tracks and was supported by the previously released singles 
                "Melanin", "Girl Next Door", "Afrikan Star", "Short N Sweet" and "Tujiangalie".[28] Sauti Sol described 
                the album as an "art and cultural exchange" project and said it would be released towards the end of 2017. 
                They also announced plans to release a new track with a different African artist every month. 
                However, this plan did not materialize due to financial constraints.

                Sauti Sol's fifth studio album Midnight Train was released on 5 June 2020. The album had songs featuring 
                guest artists from Africa. These included "Disco Matanga", featuring Sho Madjozi and "My Everything", 
                featuring India Arie.The album's most popular song "Suzanna" was released on 7 February 2020. 
                Sauti Sol recorded five different versions of the song before settling on the one they released. 
                The accompanying music video for "Suzanna" was shot in Lagos, Nigeria[33] and was directed by Leki Isama. 
                However, the lead song for the album is "Midnight Train", which is where the album gets its name from. 
                Other songs in the album are Rhumba Japani, Sober, Feel My Love, Insecure, Nenda Lote, Brighter Days, 
                Set Me Free and Wake Up.

            <h2>List of most viewed collabos by sauti sol band </h2>
            1.Melanin ft Patoranking<br>

            This one captured the hearts of many. Using black girls with melanin in plenty as the theme of the song saw it 
            become so very popular and people just could not have enough of it. Melanin was indeed a perfect one. 
            10 million views show energy and loyalty.<br>

            2.Africa ft Yemi Alade<br>
            This vivacious and energetic mama sells nothing short of good vocals and her appearance does command attention. 
            This song was a simple one with a clear and pure message, but the beats did steal our hearts and the features in 
            the video, saw it hit 10 Million views.<br>

            3. Unconditionally Bae ft Ali Kiba<br>
           Incorporating Tanzania’s bongo badass saw this song garner 6.5 million views without spending cash on promoting the song. 
            Those abs and big chest out in the video, really motivated us to watch them over and over again.<br>

            4.African Star ft Burna Boy<br>

            Nigeria’s bad boy Burna Boy, has got a voice to die for. Working with our boys on the song gave us nothing but pleasure and enthusiasm. 
            The song is so charming and no wonder it hit 2.2 million views in such a short time.<br>
        <p> It was a great achievement for sauti sol band to collaborate with different singers as they gain fame and earned alot from the songs.
            From the list above most song on youtube are over 10 million views.T his is a clear evidence that sauti band earned more money
            from the collabos.
